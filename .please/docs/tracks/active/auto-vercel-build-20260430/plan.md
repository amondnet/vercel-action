# Plan: Local Vercel Build Step (`vercel-build` input)

> Track: auto-vercel-build-20260430
> Spec: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Overview

- **Source**: /please:plan
- **Track**: auto-vercel-build-20260430
- **Issue**: TBD (created by /please:new-track)
- **Created**: 2026-04-30
- **Approach**: New `VercelBuildRunner` module + pre-deploy step in `run()`

## Purpose

Add an opt-in `vercel-build` action input that executes the official Vercel CLI workflow (`vercel pull` → `vercel build`) inside the GitHub Actions runner before deployment, then reuses the existing prebuilt deploy path to upload `.vercel/output`. Lets users build inside CI with their own secrets/runtime instead of relying on Vercel's remote build.

## Context

The action currently has two deploy paths: API-based (default, uploads source via `@vercel/client`) and CLI-based (when `vercel-args` is provided, runs `npx vercel ...`). The `prebuilt` input already exists and routes to the API path with prebuilt upload of `.vercel/output`.

This track adds a third orchestration: when `vercel-build: true`, run `vercel pull` + `vercel build` locally first, then funnel into the existing prebuilt API path. The change is additive and opt-in — existing pipelines see no behavior change.

## Architecture Decision

**Chosen: New `src/vercel-build.ts` module + pre-deploy orchestration in `src/index.ts`** (Approach A from architecture review).

Rejected: embedding build logic inside `VercelApiClient.deploy()` (Approach B). Reasons for rejection: couples subprocess execution to the API client, violates AGENTS.md "isolate side effects at boundary," and harder to unit-test in isolation.

Key design points:
- `@vercel/client` v17 does **not** expose `build`/`pull` primitives; the SDK fallback in spec FR-5 is therefore void. We invoke the bundled `vercel` package via `@actions/exec` (same pattern as `vercel-cli.ts`).
- Mutual exclusivity (`vercel-build: true` + `prebuilt: true`) is enforced in `getActionConfig()` so the action fails before any network/IO.
- After a successful local build, the runner mutates a copy of `ActionConfig` to set `prebuilt = true`, then the existing `VercelApiClient` deploys `.vercel/output` unchanged. No changes to `vercel-api.ts` are required.
- Build failure surfaces as a custom `BuildFailedError` carrying a truncated stderr tail; the `run()` catch block recognizes this error type and posts a build-failure comment (PR or commit) before rethrowing.

## Tasks

- [x] T001 Add `vercel-build` input to action.yml and `vercelBuild` field to `ActionConfig` type (file: action.yml, src/types.ts)
- [x] T002 [P] Add unit tests for `vercel-build` input parsing in `getActionConfig()` (file: src/__tests__/config.test.ts) (depends on T001)
- [x] T003 Parse `vercel-build` input in `getActionConfig()` and enforce mutual exclusivity with `prebuilt` (file: src/config.ts) (depends on T002)
- [x] T004 [P] Add unit tests for `BuildFailedError` class (file: src/__tests__/vercel-build.test.ts)
- [x] T005 Implement `BuildFailedError` class with stderr tail capture (file: src/vercel-build.ts) (depends on T004)
- [x] T006 [P] Add unit tests for `runVercelPull()` and `runVercelBuild()` exec wrappers — covers happy path, scope propagation, build-env, target=production, exit-code failure (file: src/__tests__/vercel-build.test.ts) (depends on T005)
- [x] T007 Implement `runVercelPull()` and `runVercelBuild()` using `@actions/exec` with streamed stdout/stderr listeners (file: src/vercel-build.ts) (depends on T006)
- [x] T008 [P] Add unit tests for `runBuildStep()` orchestrator — verifies pull → build sequencing, returns `{ prebuilt, vercelOutputDir }`, propagates `BuildFailedError` (file: src/__tests__/vercel-build.test.ts) (depends on T007)
- [x] T009 Implement `runBuildStep(config)` orchestrator that calls pull + build and returns updated config fragment (file: src/vercel-build.ts) (depends on T008)

## Verification

Manual verification (run after T013):

1. **Happy path (preview)**: In `example/nextjs`, set `vercel-build: 'true'`, `prebuilt: 'false'`. Run the action against a real Vercel project (preview token). Expect: log shows `vercel pull` then `vercel build` invocations, `.vercel/output` is uploaded, deployment URL returned.
2. **Happy path (production)**: Set `target: production` + `vercel-build: 'true'`. Expect: `vercel pull --environment=production` and `vercel build --prod` invoked.
3. **Mutual exclusivity**: Set `vercel-build: 'true'` AND `prebuilt: 'true'`. Expect: action fails immediately with a clear conflict message; no API calls made.
4. **Build failure**: In a fixture project, introduce a syntax error so `vercel build` fails. Expect: action exits non-zero, GitHub Actions log shows the build error, PR comment is posted with truncated tail (when `github-comment: true`).
5. **Backward compatibility**: With `vercel-build` unset (or `false`), run an existing-style deployment. Expect: identical behavior to current main branch — no `vercel pull`/`vercel build` invocations.
6. **Token redaction**: Inspect logs from steps 1–4. The Vercel token MUST NOT appear in any log line, comment, or error message.

Automated:
- `pnpm test` — all unit tests green
- `pnpm test --coverage` — coverage for new code > 80%
- `pnpm run lint` — no errors
- `pnpm run build` — clean build, no warnings

## Progress

- 2026-04-30 — T001+T002+T003 completed: `vercel-build` input added to action.yml, `vercelBuild` field added to ActionConfig, parser + mutual-exclusivity validation in getActionConfig(), 6 new tests (43 total config tests passing).
- 2026-04-30 — T004+T005 completed: `BuildFailedError` class with `fromOutput()` factory and stderr-tail capture (last 20 lines, fallback to stdout when stderr empty). 7 tests passing.
- 2026-04-30 — T006+T007 completed: `runVercelPull()` + `runVercelBuild()` via `@actions/exec`, with `--scope`, `-t <token>`, `--environment=<target>`, `--prod` (production only), `buildEnv` merged into exec env. 10 new tests (17 total in vercel-build.test.ts).
- 2026-04-30 — T008+T009 completed: `runBuildStep(config)` orchestrator runs pull → build sequentially, returns `{ prebuilt: true, vercelOutputDir }`. 4 new tests (21 total).
- 2026-04-30 — T010+T011 completed: `createBuildFailureCommentOnPullRequest()` and `createBuildFailureCommentOnCommit()` helpers in github-comments.ts. Wraps stderr tail in fenced code block, warns (does not throw) on API failure. 5 new tests (16 total in github-comments.test.ts).
- 2026-04-30 — T012+T013 completed: `run()` exported and wired with `maybeRunVercelBuild()` (no-op when vercelBuild=false; otherwise runs build then mutates config to prebuilt). BuildFailedError caught to post failure comment before rethrow. Top-level `run()` invocation guarded by `process.env.VITEST` check to prevent double-execution under tests. 3 new integration tests in run-build.test.ts. Full suite: 252 tests passing.
- 2026-04-30 — T014 completed: emulate.dev integration test (3 tests) verifying runBuildStep produces correct vercelOutputDir, end-to-end deploy through real emulator using prebuilt output, and fail-fast on pull error. Full suite: 272 tests passing.
- 2026-04-30 — T015 completed: README updated with `vercel-build` input row, "Method 4 - Build inside the action" usage example, KB workflow reference, and notes on mutual exclusivity, build-env, target=production, and failure comments.
- 2026-04-30 — T016 completed: dist/ rebuilt via `pnpm build` (4336 kB bundle). Coverage: vercel-build.ts 94.39% (> 80% NFR-4 target), overall lines 87.42%.

## Decision Log

- **2026-04-30 — Approach A (new module) chosen over embedding in VercelApiClient.** Reason: separation of concerns, AGENTS.md compliance (boundary isolation), reuse of existing prebuilt deploy path with zero modification.
- **2026-04-30 — `@actions/exec` chosen over SDK.** Reason: `@vercel/client` v17 does not expose `build`/`pull` primitives; the spec's "SDK if available, else exec" condition resolves to "exec" deterministically.
- **2026-04-30 — Mutual exclusivity validated in `getActionConfig()`.** Reason: fail-fast at the input boundary before any network or filesystem I/O.
